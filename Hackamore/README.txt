ABSTRACT

This is the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hackamore package. Hackamore is a
framework and application written in Python that maintains a dynamic model of
the call states of one or more Asterisk PBXes using the Asterisk Management
Interface (AMI). It was inspired by prior work done in C by Mark Jackson at
Aircell Business Aviation LLC. Hackamore is a work in progress.

The unit tests for this project have been run on Python 2.7.5 under MacOS
"Mavericks", and on Python 2.7.3 under Ubuntu 12.04 "precise".

This software is an original work of its author(s).
